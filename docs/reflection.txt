To scale data collection effectively, we must balance facilitator effort with useful insights. 
Right now, free-form notes are rich but slow and inconsistent. Switching to a lightweight, 
structured input system keeps important behavioral signals while cutting the time facilitators 
spend writing.

A simple two-part template works well: quick behavioral flags (for example, “emotional 
event,” “social moment,” or “conflict”) plus an optional short description. Facilitators can 
capture key moments fast, and the short text preserves context when needed. Collected entries 
can then be processed in batches with an AI pipeline (e.g., GPT-3.5-Turbo) to produce consistent 
emotional regulation and social integration scores, along with brief resilience summaries.

Giving facilitators near-real-time feedback through dashboards increases engagement and 
improves data quality. When they see their inputs turned into structured scores and charts, 
they understand the value of accurate reporting. Alerts for missing or extreme values let 
them correct entries quickly, reducing later cleaning work.

Automating scoring standardizes assessments and cuts manual workload so facilitators can 
focus more on interacting with children than paperwork. This approach scales efficiently: 
rather than hiring more staff, we leverage AI to expand capacity while keeping costs manageable.

The dashboard for this system summarizes average scores and observation distributions across 
children, which helps monitor both individual development and group trends. It’s a practical 
tool for spotting changes, identifying children who need support, and tracking program impact.

Future improvements might include short facilitator training modules, tools for trend analysis, 
and capturing contextual metadata like mood or environment to deepen interpretation.

In short, a light structured input method combined with AI-driven scoring and timely feedback 
creates a scalable, efficient system. It preserves the richness of observations while making 
data collection faster, more consistent, and more actionable.
