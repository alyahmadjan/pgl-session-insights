To improve data collection at scale, the key is balancing facilitator effort with insightful 
output. Currently, free-form notes contain rich qualitative detail, but are time-consuming 
to produce and variable in quality. Shifting to a lightweight, structured input system could drastically 
reduce facilitator effort while retaining important behavioral signals.

A two-part facilitator template can help: quick behavioral flags (e.g., emotional event, social 
moment, conflict) paired with an optional short descriptive snippet. This enables facilitators 
to capture key elements rapidly without lengthy writing. Subsequently, batch AI processing using 
the existing GPT-3.5-Turbo pipeline can generate reliable emotional regulation and social 
integration scores plus resilience summaries.

Providing facilitators near-real-time feedback through dashboards enhances engagement and 
data accuracy, as they see their inputs reflected in structured form. Alerts for extreme or 
missing values enable quick corrections, minimizing downstream cleaning.

Automating scoring standardizes assessments and significantly cuts manual workload, allowing 
facilitators to focus more on their direct interactions with children. This option scales 
efficiently by leveraging AI rather than expanding staffing proportionally.

The attached dashboard reflects these structured insights, showing average scores and 
observation distributions across children—valuable for monitoring both individual development 
and group trends.

Future improvements could include integrating facilitator training, trend analysis tools, 
and contextual meta-data (e.g., mood, environment) to enrich understanding further.

In summary, combining light structured inputs with AI-driven analysis and timely feedback 
creates an efficient, scalable model that preserves the richness of facilitator observations 
while maximizing productivity and insight generation.
